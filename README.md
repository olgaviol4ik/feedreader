# Project Overview
In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included Jasmine and even started writing their first test suite! 
Used Jasmine 2.1.2 to develop test suites.

## How to view this project:
Download the repository from github: https://github.com/mattb7800/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
Open the "index.html" file in your browser. Udacity Blog appears.
Scroll to the bottom to see the Jasmine test suites.
You will find the code for the Jasmine tests in the feedreader.js file.
